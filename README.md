##My-process

###built-with
-Semantic HTML-5 markup
-CSS-3 custom properties

###What i learned - 

This project has really equiped and boasted my knowledge in frontend web development.
During the coding of the structure, that is the HTML, i learned how important it is to structure well.
When i started to write the css i realised i needed to re-write the HTML again. This really helped me understand the concept and principles behind 
web development.
I aslo learned alot during the css.
I had to put in practise what i have learned during the responsive web design training at freecodecamp.
I strugle in the beggning with the css but later i grew into it.
I can confidently say that i did this entire project on my own.

###Continued-development
There are areas i want to improve on:
CSS Flexbox and Grid- One area i will want to improve at.
Css media querries as well.

###Useful-resources
[Youtube-CodewithEric] - This channel on youtube helped me alot with regards to writting media querries for all screen resolutions.
[AmaliTech coding handbook] -  This book also help me to understand the essentials of using unambigious words during my code. The use of simple and clear words is good.
